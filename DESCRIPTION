Description: 
    An image analysis toolkit for plant phenotyping that segments green 
    objects (such as leaves, fruits, and grains) from RGB images using 
    OpenCV-based color space thresholding. The package computes real-world 
    area and perimeter measurements via pixel-to-centimeter calibration 
    and exports annotated images and summary tables for downstream 
    statistical analysis.
